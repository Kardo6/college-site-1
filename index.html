            <p>The Cape fox is nocturnal and most active just before dawn or after dusk; it can be spotted during the
                early mornings and early evenings. During the day, it typically shelters in burrows underground, holes,
                hollows, or dense thickets. It is an active digger that will excavate its own burrow, although it
                generally modifies an abandoned burrow of another species, such as the springhare, to its specific
                requirements.[</p>
            <p>Cape fox is the only species in the genus Vulpes that exists in Africa south of the equator. It primarily
                occupies arid and semi-arid areas, but in sections, such as the fynbos biome of the western Cape
                Province of South Africa, the species reaches areas of higher rainfall and denser vegetation.[1] In the
                central and western regions of southern Africa, the species is widespread, reaching around 15 Â° N in
                south-western Angola.[8] It is widespread in Zimbabwe, Botswana, and South Africa, occurring in most
                parts of the Western and Northern Cape provinces, the Eastern Cape (excluding the southeastern side),
                the Free State, western and northwestern KwaZulu-Natal and the North-West province. It also occurs in
                Lesotho, a high mountainous region.[9]

            <p>Fennec foxes, red foxes, cape foxes, Ruppell's foxes, pale foxes, and bat-eared foxes are the six fox
                species
                living on this continent.</p>
            <p>The ears are relatively large and sharp, the muzzle is small and pointed. Pelage colour is silvery-gray,
                tawny at the back of the ears, with white hairs appearing around the side of the pinna in the center.[4]
                The
                colour of the neck and sides is lighter, and the underparts are pale tawny to pale buff.[6] The head is
                dull
                red and the lower jaw is dark brown. There are white marks on the throat. The legs are more tawny than
                the
                rest of the body.[5] The tail is dense and bushy, and can be silvery, pale fawn, buff with brown or
                black
                tips, or dull yellow. The tail tip is always black,[4] and there's a dark spot over the caudal gland.[6]
